Photini
=======

Easy to use digital photograph metadata (EXIF, IPTC, XMP) editing application.

Dependencies
------------

*   Python, version 2.6+ (Python 3 is not yet supported): <http://python.org/>
*   PyQt, version 4+: <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>
*   pyexiv2, version 0.3.2: <https://launchpad.net/pyexiv2>.

Python and PyQt should be available from the repository of any modern Linux distribution. pyexiv2 is available from some Linux repositories, or from <http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html>. If you need to build pyexiv2 you'll need to install boost.Python, libexiv2 and SCons. See <http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/developers.html#dependencies> for details and build instructions.

Python for Windows can be downloaded from <http://www.python.org/getit/windows/>. PyQt for Windows can be downloaded from <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/download> and pyexiv2 for Windows can be downloaded from <http://tilloy.net/dev/pyexiv2/download.html>. Make sure you choose the Windows installers that match your Python version and system bit width.

I hope that Photini will be a cross-platform application - do let me know if you try it on Windows or MacOS.

Warning
-------

This software is currently at a very early stage of development. I've put it on github as a backup, and so anyone interested can have a look and give me some early feedback. Before using it be sure to back up all your photographs (you do this anyway, right?) as I can't guarantee you won't accidentally damage them.
